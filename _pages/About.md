I'm an award-winning, **Toronto-based level designer and game developer**. I graduated from Sheridan College with a *Bachelors of Art in Game Design* and now make games for work and for play.

*​English* is my native language, but I also speak fluent *Pig-Latin* as well as basic French. I know how to read the Korean alphabet too (I just might not know what it means).

​I *actively volunteer* towards initiatives and educational opportunities like *convention panels and workshops* in an effort to educate others about the art of making video games.

In my free time I have too many hobbies to count, including (but not exclusive to): Photography, Illustration, 3D Printing, Electronics and Streaming!

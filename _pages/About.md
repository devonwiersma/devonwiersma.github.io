<span style= "color: #ffd500ff" > As you probably figured out, I'm Devon! </span>

I'm an award-winning, **Toronto-based level designer and game developer**. I graduated from Sheridan College with a *Bachelors of Art in Game Design* and now make games for work and for play, as well as teach emerging devs how to do the same.

*​English* is my native language, but I also speak fluent *Pig-Latin* as well as some essential *French*. I know how to read the Korean alphabet too (I just might not be able to tell you what it means).

In my free time I have too many hobbies to count, including (but not exclusive to): *Photography, Illustration, 3D Printing, Electronics and Streaming*!

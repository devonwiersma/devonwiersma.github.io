title:  "New Blog, New Me?"
---

Okay just kidding, it's not REALLY a new me.

This is my first post on this new site, which I put together using [Github Pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages), a [Jekyll](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll) template called [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes), and a whole lot of patience.

## So why a new site now?

I've been thinking about how I wanted a place to post long-form thoughts about subjects (probably mostly about media, art, and video games) for a while now. First I was exploring Neocities as a possibility, but frankly I found it to be a little janky. It seems fun for making a little hobby site, but the idea of fighting the raw HTML to put my professional work on there in a way that could be easily displayed is way too much effort. I was also thinking of figuring out how to entirely self-host it myself - that is until I learned Github Pages is free and that self-hosting your own site is not only unreliable but also potentially leaves your network open to attacks and the like.

We've also been going through some financial issues lately and been needing to tighten our belts, and I realized I was paying $40 a month (!!!) for Squarespace, which is WILD. I was paying it annually so it kept slipping under my radar as being a huge expense, and every time I would get charged for it  - it's as much as my *gym membership*! And besides that I only ever update my Squarespace when I start or stop a new project (which, frankly, is very rare these days given the state of the games industry), so it's really not worth $450 a year for a site that just sits around all day.

## So what will you find here?

As I mentioned, probably long-form thoughts about media, art, and video games! Some days I feel like I just need to journal or word vomit things out, and social media sites leave so little room for things like nuance or really in-depth explorations of stuff. I want a place I can put that stuff out, even if no one pays attention to it.

I also want to talk more about things like my thoughts on art (in my own illustration and otherwise), as well as have a place to post my work and direct employers towards. For a long time I've kept different parts of myself divided in different corners of the internet, and I'd like to carve a space where I can bring them all together again (for better or for worse).

Anyway, I've never **really** created my own site before and all this is quite a learning process. I've dabbled in HTML and CSS but there's quite a few things I don't know or don't fully understand that I'll learn along the way I'm sure. If it's anything like making games there will be plenty of things I don't know (and probably won't ever know) too. I've already learned (alongside my various other tech projects) that I hate any process that makes me open a terminal or command line things via Git, so webdev definitely doesn't seem like it's a job for me. 🥲

On that note, I should get back to building this site lest I leave it too long and lose a ton of more money to Squarespace.

Bye!
